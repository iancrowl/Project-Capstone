# Project-Capstone
<p> By Ian Crowl; </p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p> I cloned the repo from Sabbrir420 at url https://github.com/sabbir420/capstone-project-cloud-devops, but refactored many of the exisiting files to make this project my own.</p>

<p> Using the skills achieved from the previous lessons, I was able to crated two docker images, A and B, to deploy my modifications to my index.html file. :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using AWS cli and kubectl cli</li>
	<li>Using Jenkins to implement A Deployment A and Deployment B with Jenkins pipelines</li>
	<li>Used CloudFormation to deploy the Kubernetes cluster in EKS</li>
	<li>Built the Clustergroup Manually</li>
	<li>building a docker image locally to test</li>
</ul>

***
<p>Using an nginx image and a simple imdex.html file, I applied this to a docker image A and image B.  I then deployed this images to my DockerHub.  I used CloudFormation templates to deploy my network and cluster. I build the Cluster nodes manually. 
I made an error in my index.html file so that I could show a linting error.  I then corrected the error. I dent deployed image A, took A screen shot. lastly, deployed image B and took a screen shot.
